GeoPact grounds infrastructure in relatable physical activities, that are linked with holistic views of the system, and creates new experiences for public engagement. In these activities participants were invited to roleplay as couriers, and to progress through delivery scenarios which were governed by smart contracts.

Next, we leveraged a daily mood representation in Hidden Markov Models to determine its associations with subsequent self-reported symptoms. We found that individuals who have specific mood patterns are highly likely to have reported high depressive symptoms. However, not all of the high symptoms individuals necessarily displayed this characteristic, which indicates presence of potential subgroups driving these findings. Finally, we leveraged multiple mood representations to characterize levels of depression symptoms with a logistic regression model.

Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visualizations is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed.

In part, this is due to the use of unrecyclable materials and custom-built hardware. However, it is also due to the limited value people place on these objects (e.g., sentimental and environmental). This one-day workshop will explore how the configuration of values designed into IoT objects influences the end-user practices of disposal, recycling and upcycling.

The paper uses a workshop method to explore socio-economic models in order to better balance the multiple imaginaries that participants hold with the opportunity to design disruptive and critical propositions.

While fluency scores are typically reported as the number of unique words produced, several alternative manual scoring methods have been proposed that provide additional insights into performance, such as clusters of semantically related items. Many automatic scoring methods yield metrics that are difficult to relate to thetheories behind manual scoring methods, and most require manually-curated linguistic ontologies or large corpus infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic scoring method based on Wikipedia, Backlink-VSM, which is easily adaptable to any of the 61 languages with more than 100k Wikipedia entries, can account for cultural differences in semantic relatedness, and coversa wide range of item categories. Our Backlink-VSM method combines relational knowledge as represented by links between Wikipedia entries (Backlink model) with a semantic proximity metric derived from distributional representations (vector space model; VSM). Backlink-VSM yields measures that approximate manual clustering and switching analyses, providing a straightforwardlink to the substantial literature that uses these metrics. We illustrate our approach with examples from two languages (English and Korean), and two commonly used categories of items (animals and fruits). For both Korean and English, we show that the measures generated by our automatic scoring procedure correlate well with manual annotations. We also successfully replicate findings that older adults produce significantly fewer switches compared to younger adults. Furthermore, our automatic scoring procedure outperforms the manual scoring method and a WordNet-based model in separating younger and older participants measured by binary classification accuracy for both English and Korean datasets. Our method also generalizes to a different category (fruit),demonstrating its adaptability.",  keywords  = "verbal fluency, semantic fluency, executive functions, semantic memory, word embeddings, relation extraction, category fluency test",  author    = "Najoung Kim and Jung-Ho Kim and Maria Wolters and MacPherson, {Sarah E.} and Park, {Jong C.}",  note      = "Open Access",  year      = "2019",  month     = may,  day       = "16",  doi       = "10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01020",  language  = "English",  volume    = "10",  pages     = "1--16",  journal   = "Frontiers in Psychology",  issn      = "1664-1078",  publisher = "Frontiers Media S.A.", }

However, ordinary people who are citizens and users of these emerging technologies have rarely been involved in the processes that inform these policies, governance mechanisms and design due to the institutionalised processes that prioritise objective knowledge over subjective ones. People's subjective experiences are often discarded. This priority is likely to further widen the gap between people, technology policies and design as technologies advance towards delegated human agencies, which decreases human interfaces in technology-mediated relationships with objects, systems, services, trade and other (often) unknown third-party beneficiaries. Such a disconnection can have serious implications for policy implementation, especially when it involves human limitations. To address this disconnection, we argue that a space for people to meaningfully contribute their subjective knowledge - experienceto complex technology policies that, in turn, shape their experience and well-being needs to be constructed.

For our forthcoming scoping review on this topic, we tested our protocol on the results of a quick search of one publicly available resource (the National Institute of Health{\textquoteright}s PubMed service).The review protocol trial was used to (i) gain further clarity on the inclusion and exclusion criteria; (ii) develop an easy to use extraction scheme for full text extraction within the software tool Covidence; (iii) refine the research questions; (iv) generate seed papers for the main search.Methods: Medline-PubMed was searched through the web interface on June 17, 2018 by MW. The database was chosen because it is easily accessible, and represents the most up to date variant of Medline. The search queries used were:(i) (({"}mental health{"}[All Fields] AND {"}community{"}[All Fields]) OR {"}community mental health{"}[All Fields]) AND ({"}{"}[MeSH Terms] OR {"}{"}[All Fields])(ii) “mental health{"}[All Fields] AND {"}task shifting{"}[All Fields] Query (i) was run separately for each of the SAARC countries. MW excluded clearly irrelevant abstracts manually before exporting to reference software (Zotero) to focus on core inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results of Query (i) and Query (ii) were merged using Zotero. We included study protocols, implementation studies, and pre/post study designs as well as randomised controlled trials. We also included editorials and position papers, in case they might contain brief descriptions of interventions. The rapid PubMed search was supplemented by a search of the grey literature through mailshot. Results: 152 abstracts were entered into Covidence. Three (two percent) were excluded as duplicates. Of the remaining 149 (ninety-eight percent) studies, sixty (forty percent) were excluded as irrelevant through abstract screening, and eighty-nine (sixty percent) full texts were reviewed. Seventy-one (eighty-one percent) of those were excluded, leaving eighteen (nineteen percent) studies for full extraction. Thirty-one (forty-five percent) of the excluded papers did not describe a group intervention, twenty-one (thirty percent) did not describe an intervention, nine (ten percent) did not include information about who was treated by whom, where, and how, six (nine percent) were not from SAARC, two (four percent) were delivered by a health professional, one (one percent) included a paediatric population, and one (one percent) was an undetected duplicate.

Artists can make the boundaries of systems visible and offer novel ways to make the reasoning of AI transparent and decipherable. Beyond this, artistic practice can explore new configurations of humans and algorithms, mapping the terrain of inter-agencies between people and machines.

Humans are also extremely efficient at forgetting trivial or irrelevant details when they are no longer needed. Indeed, managed preservation and forgetting could be viewed as a set of human {\textquoteleft}superpowers{\textquoteright} achieved through use of a lifetime of accumulated knowledge, highly effective contextualisation, aggregation, organisation, summarisation and reconstruction of key features of experiences. But humans are poor at preservation of large amounts of detail. Typically, memories are partially reconstructed during the retrieval process, and this reconstruction process can sometimes lead to false memories. Many of these strengths and limitations of human memory are well understood by human memory researchers, although important questions and uncertainties remain. In complete contrast, digital systems excel in preserving large amounts of detail, and are getting better at contextualisation. But they remain rather poor at systematic forgetting of irrelevant detail. Often, digital forgetting occurs by accident through disk crashes, incompatible upgrades of software and hardware, lost or stolen storage devices. Even if the data are still present and safely stored, insufficient indexing and poor information retrieval may result in those data effectively being forgotten. This chapter will provide a detailed overview of the state of the science of human memory, based on empirical studies and conceptual modelling. It will discuss how the human superpowers of managed preservation and forgetting are achieved, and show how a conceptual understanding of human memory function could be used to inspire the design of digital managed preservation and forgetting. It will argue that human-inspired digital forgetting is key for achieving a truly synergetic relationship between human and digital memory, and explore how such a synergetic relationship can address aspects of the paradox that massive investment in technology has not necessarily led to the expected increase in productivity (IT/productivity paradox). Next, we will describe an in-depth study of personal, digital photograph collections that were contributed by volunteer research participants. This study explored human management of photographic collections and contrasted it with managed preservation and forgetting of the same photo collection by an example digital system that incorporates automated conceptualisation and forgetting. The chapter will conclude with a summary of how understanding human cognitive function can help to inspire more useful digital storage systems that offer reliable and usable tools to complement and support human memory rather than attempt to replace it.",  author    = "Robert Logie and Maria Wolters and Elaine Niven",  year      = "2018",  month     = mar,  day       = "20",  doi       = "10.1007/978-3-319-73465-1_2",  language  = "English",  isbn      = "9783319734644",  series    = "Springer Series on Cultural Computing",  publisher = "Springer International Publishing AG",  pages     = "9--45",  editor    = "Vaileios Mezaris and Claudia Niederee and Robert Logie",  booktitle = "Personal Multimedia Preservation",  address   = "Switzerland", }

I will critically interrogate this discourse through the lens of three concepts: biographical illness work; evidence-based medicine; and neurodiversity. Evidence-based medicine emphasises the uncertain nature of much diagnostic work, and critically questions the basis on which diagnoses are made. Biographical illness work covers how people interpret the diagnoses they receive, how diagnosis affects their identity, and how they cope with preconceptions and stigma associated with a diagnosis. Finally, neurodiversity questions what should be regarded as normal, instead focusing on the experience of people who live with a particular condition. I will conclude by showing how this critical interrogation can stimulate the design of new processes, contexts, and technologies that give people greater control over who infers what about their health from their data.

From a critique of acceleration to an urge to frame present actions within more extended futures, designers have been analysing how different temporal perceptions may influence practices and how they can be influenced by design.

Instead of regarding time largely in terms of pace and direction, they should start considering the complexity of aspects that sustain the coordination of particular groups. We present this approach through the concept of Temporal Design, which endeavours to reveal actors, practices and forces that determine social coordination within specific contexts.

When sensors capture data about people, and digital systems interpret and respond to that data below the line of user visibility, two fundamental questions arise. First, are current notions of consent relevant in the emerging class of pervasive systems and, secondly, what are the practical consequences of dealing with consent for such environments? This paper reflects on the key principles of consent and the challenges raised by pervasive systems through a review of multidisciplinary perspectives on consent and technology. The developing complexity and decreasing visibility of pervasive computing systems, coupled with the increasing value and sensitivity of personal data, mean that it is no longer sufficient to design systems that assume users capable of making informed decisions at a single moment. In particular, the unprecedented sensitivity of contextual data, and the potential harms associated with inferences made on the basis of that data, highlights the need to revisit our design principles. Many of these discussions are nuanced and implicate a broad range of perspectives; however, it is clear that there is unlikely to be a 'moment of consent' in pervasive systems. In order to progress this agenda we offer the following set of recommendations to designers, as considerations for future systems design: (i) electronic consent mechanisms (ECMs) must cease to be designed around 'moments in time' and allow for negotiation, (ii) systems should enable establishment of user expectations and development of norms, (iii) systems should be sensitive to third-party interactions and (iv) we should move beyond designing for user control towards designing for user autonomy.",  keywords  = "consent, personal information, privacy, ubiquitous computing",  author    = "E.

The assumption has been that these findings are attributable to physiological and cognitive degradation associated with normal aging [1]. In other words, reduced performance is inevitable and predictable by chronological age. The size of these effects can be task dependent, but evidence across a range of HCI tasks suggests that computer experience can reduce age-related differences in viewing behaviour [2]. Eye-movement patterns and distributions for experienced older adults are remarkably close to those for younger adults carrying out similar tasks. And within a sample of older adults (n=18, age range: 70-93), even a minimal level of computer familiarity is enough to create significantly distinguishable groups. This implies that treating all older adults as a single cohort is a gross oversimplification. Additionally, in many usability studies these visual aspects of interaction are confounded by physical performance difficulties, such as mouse control or typing.

The effect of prosodic factors, such as intonation and pausing, on language processing remains controversial. While there is an obvious relationship between punctuation and prosody it cannot be a simple mapping: grammatical rules prevent the inclusion of punctuation at points where a speaker might pause, and the set of punctuation is not rich enough to transcribe all the spoken features categorised as prosody. It is therefore important for any realistic text-to-speech (or speech-to-text) conversion to consider these important features of language. An experimental investigation showed that commas exert a consistently strong and direct rhetorical influence on sentences being read aloud. They result in the slower delivery of words preceding the comma and an increase in pauses in speech. While the lengthening effect is an uncontroversial feature found at the end of clauses, even in the absence of punctuation, there is evidence to suggest that the comma is particularly useful in acoustically segmenting text by stimulating a gap, or period of silence, between linguistic units. This is particularly salient at points where a break can convey disambiguating information. Somewhat surprisingly, commas do not induce shifts in the fundamental frequency of speech or alter intonational patterns. Any generation of naturalistic synthetic speech should therefore take these factors into consideration.

Signal detection analysis on visual features and Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering gaze was used to identify the contribution of visual features to gaze location. The results show that mid-level visual features including corners and orientations can distinguish between actual gaze locations and a randomly sampled baseline. However, temporal features such as flicker, motion, and their respective contrasts were the most predictive of gaze location. Additionally, moments in which all viewers{\textquoteright} gaze tightly clustered in the same location could be predicted by motion.

Unlike static scenes, the inclusion of transients such as motion and the flow of information in a dynamic scene may result in a greater exogenous control of attention but also necessitate moment-by-moment endogenous guidance in order to filter out irrelevant visual events. These factors were investigated in a series of studies recording the eye movements of participants whilst they watched a range of composed (e.g. TV and film) and naturalistic dynamic scenes under different viewing tasks. The best low-level predictor of gaze allocation during free-viewing of dynamic scenes is motion and motion contrast predicts the degree of clustering of gaze across multiple viewers. However, this bias towards motion can be overridden by viewing tasks that prioritise static features such as background, e.g. recognise the location. Gaze behaviour whilst free-viewing dynamic scenes depicting people engaged in recognisable events (e.g. doing the laundry) suggest that attention to motion may not be evidence of exogenous capture but rather a moment-by-moment interaction between motion, the semantic structure of naturalistic events and higher-order factors such as familiarity, memory and expectation.The data presented was gathered during projects funded by the Leverhulme Trust (Ref F/00-158/BZ) and the ESRC (RES-062-23-1092).",  author    = "Smith, {Tim J.} and Mital, {Parag K.} and Henderson, {John M.} and Hill, {Robin L.}",  year      = "2011",  doi       = "10.16910/jemr.4.3.1",  language  = "English",  series    = "Journal of eye movement research",  publisher = "Iffwil: European Group for Eye Movement Research",  editor    = "Francoise Vitu and Eric Castet and Laurent Goffart",  booktitle = "16th European Conference on Eye Movements Conference Abstracts",  note      = "16th European Conference on Eye Movement (ECEM 2011) ; Conference date: 21-08-2011 Through 25-08-2011", }

Most research on sentence parsing has either avoided the use of punctuation or simply assumed that it necessarily serves a disambiguating role. There has been little or no consideration of how {\textquoteleft}disambiguation{\textquoteright} might occur or of the precise nature of the effects that punctuation might have on the reading process. Previous work using self-paced reading (Hill and Murray, 1997a, b) has in fact shown that simplistic assumptions related to the disambiguating effect of punctuation cannot be supported. These studies demonstrated that while punctuation plays a potent disambiguating role in some structures, the effect is by no means universal. It remained unclear, however, whether these conclusions could be generalised to a more natural reading situation and whether eye-movement patterns while reading punctuated text provide an insight into the underlying parsing mechanisms. In this chapter we discuss more recent studies which have extended this work by monitoring subjects{\textquoteright} eye movements while reading exemplars of three types of locally ambiguous items with and without inserted punctuation. In order to control for simple oculomotor effects related to the additional spacing associated with punctuation, the studies also included a condition with equivalent spacing but without punctuation. The results show potent effects of punctuation on the first-pass processing of two structures (early-closure and reduced relative-clause constructions), but not in the {\textquoteleft}preferred{\textquoteright} versions of either of these and not in sentences containing prepositional phrase ambiguities. Punctuation also exerted effects on local processing difficulty, suggesting that it cues parsing decisions at particular points in a sentence. Frequently, inserted punctuation increased processing time on sections of a sentence immediately preceding a comma, while facilitating the processing which followed. The focus of this chapter, however, is on the effects of punctuation on eye-movement parameters in punctuated and unpunctuated sentences, the ways in which these differ from unpunctuated sentences with equivalent spacing and the extent to which they reflect the processing consequences of punctuation and spacing. It was found that punctuation and increased spacing between words had similar effects on the pattern of eye movements with increases in saccade extent of more than the added character space, but this similarity was not mirrored in equivalent effects on reading time and disambiguation. Punctuation therefore appears to convey information related to structure that is more potent than the simple {\textquoteleft}chunking{\textquoteright} of text, but this effect is limited to particular structural conditions. The results also suggest a dissociation between some eye-movement parameters and their consequences for underlying sentence processing.",  author    = "Hill, {Robin L.} and Murray, {Wayne S.}",  year      = "2000",  doi       = "10.1016/B978-008043642-5/50027-9",  language  = "English",  isbn      = "978-0-08-043642-5",  pages     = "565--589",  editor    = "Alan Kennedy and Ralph Radach and Dieter Heller and Jo{\"e}l Pynte",  booktitle = "Reading as a Perceptual Process",  publisher = "Elsevier North-Holland, Inc.", }

  title    = "Saudis' Conceptualisation of Disturbing Content on Social Media",
  abstract = "Frequent exposure to disturbing content on social media such as posts, sharing, accident news, or even photos of puppies could adversely impact users’ online experience or well-being. Several pro- tection mechanisms exist to provide users with control over content feeding into their personal spaces; such as sensitive and “show less often” markers. Better understanding of users’ concep- tions of disturbing content is a prerequisite to providing users with their desired level of privacy. As a first step, we designed a protocol combining two requirement elicitation techniques: affinity diagram and card sorting. In this paper, we report our protocol and reflect on a pilot with two transnational Saudi women groups. Finally, we suggest possible future research directions to further improve our understanding of Arab users’ needs and practices in the context of personal space maintenance.",

  abstract  = "With psychiatric conditions like depression now the leading global causing of disability, the need for innovative solutions is apparent. The promise of mental health care delivered through technology (eMentalHealth) to provide personalized care offers a promising solution that has galvanized interest worldwide. However, in order to ensure that eMentalHealth is scalable and sustainable, service delivery and health and social care policies need to be integrated into the design of technology interventions. This will require new forms of interdisciplinary collaborations that we hope to foster in this symposium. Thus, in this fourth in our series of Symposia on Computing and Mental Health, the focus will beon the intersection of the communities innovating in this space: patients, designers, data scientists, clinicians, researchers, computer scientists, developers, and entrepreneurs guided by core medical ethical principles including respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Our aim is thus to enable the vision of better mental health through ethical innovation powered by the right collaborations.",

In this paper, we report a secondary analysis of a recent ARC study of women who had experienced at least one miscarriage that focused on their information and social support needs. We find participants tend to be comfortable with seeking emotional support on Facebook, and even those who say they rarely post to Facebook engage with most group activities.

  title     = "Automatic scoring of semantic fluency",
  abstract  = "In neuropsychological assessment, semantic fluency is a widely accepted measure of executive function and access to semantic memory. While fluency scores are typically reported as the number of unique words produced, several alternative manual scoring methods have been proposed that provide additional insights into performance, such as clusters of semantically related items. Many automatic scoring methods yield metrics that are difficult to relate to thetheories behind manual scoring methods, and most require manually-curated linguistic ontologies or large corpus infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic scoring method based on Wikipedia, Backlink-VSM, which is easily adaptable to any of the 61 languages with more than 100k Wikipedia entries, can account for cultural differences in semantic relatedness, and coversa wide range of item categories. Our Backlink-VSM method combines relational knowledge as represented by links between Wikipedia entries (Backlink model) with a semantic proximity metric derived from distributional representations (vector space model; VSM). Backlink-VSM yields measures that approximate manual clustering and switching analyses, providing a straightforwardlink to the substantial literature that uses these metrics. We illustrate our approach with examples from two languages (English and Korean), and two commonly used categories of items (animals and fruits). For both Korean and English, we show that the measures generated by our automatic scoring procedure correlate well with manual annotations. We also successfully replicate findings that older adults produce significantly fewer switches compared to younger adults. Furthermore, our automatic scoring procedure outperforms the manual scoring method and a WordNet-based model in separating younger and older participants measured by binary classification accuracy for both English and Korean datasets. Our method also generalizes to a different category (fruit),demonstrating its adaptability.",

  abstract = "Introduction: While several reviews have been published about psychosocial interventions in LMIC countries, little is known about the characteristics of psychosocial, group-directed interventions led by community health workers in the SAARC countries (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, tMaldives). For our forthcoming scoping review on this topic, we tested our protocol on the results of a quick search of one publicly available resource (the National Institute of Health’s PubMed service).The review protocol trial was used to (i) gain further clarity on the inclusion and exclusion criteria; (ii) develop an easy to use extraction scheme for full text extraction within the software tool Covidence; (iii) refine the research questions; (iv) generate seed papers for the main search.Methods: Medline-PubMed was searched through the web interface on June 17, 2018 by MW. The database was chosen because it is easily accessible, and represents the most up to date variant of Medline. The search queries used were:(i) (({"}mental health{"}[All Fields] AND {"}community{"}[All Fields]) OR {"}community mental health{"}[All Fields]) AND ({"}{"}[MeSH Terms] OR {"}{"}[All Fields])(ii) “mental health{"}[All Fields] AND {"}task shifting{"}[All Fields] Query (i) was run separately for each of the SAARC countries. MW excluded clearly irrelevant abstracts manually before exporting to reference software (Zotero) to focus on core inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results of Query (i) and Query (ii) were merged using Zotero. We included study protocols, implementation studies, and pre/post study designs as well as randomised controlled trials. We also included editorials and position papers, in case they might contain brief descriptions of interventions. The rapid PubMed search was supplemented by a search of the grey literature through mailshot. Results: 152 abstracts were entered into Covidence. Three (two percent) were excluded as duplicates. Of the remaining 149 (ninety-eight percent) studies, sixty (forty percent) were excluded as irrelevant through abstract screening, and eighty-nine (sixty percent) full texts were reviewed. Seventy-one (eighty-one percent) of those were excluded, leaving eighteen (nineteen percent) studies for full extraction. Thirty-one (forty-five percent) of the excluded papers did not describe a group intervention, twenty-one (thirty percent) did not describe an intervention, nine (ten percent) did not include information about who was treated by whom, where, and how, six (nine percent) were not from SAARC, two (four percent) were delivered by a health professional, one (one percent) included a paediatric population, and one (one percent) was an undetected duplicate. Two reviewers assessed each abstract and full paper, and conflicts were resolved by discussion. As a result, we revised our criteria to exclude interventions that are delivered by trainee health professionals, that focused on families, and that describe training of mental health workers. Abstract inclusion now requires that at least one specific intervention is mentioned. Five papers from different venues were selected as seed papers. Conclusion: The fast pre-review was useful for developing better guidelines for abstract screening and clearer exclusion criteria. Conflict of Interests: KM is the author of papers potentially included in the review",

However, because of its novelty and complexity, mental models of blockchain technology are difficult to acquire. Building on embodied cognition theories and material centered-design, we report an innovative approach for the design of BlocKit, a physical three-dimensional kit for materializing blockchain infrastructure and its key entities. Through an engagement with different materials such as clay, paper, or transparent containers we identified important properties of these entities and materialized them through physical artifacts. BlocKit was evaluated by 15 experienced bitcoin users with findings indicating its value for their high level of engagement in communicating about, and designing for blockchain infrastructure. Our study advances an innovative approach for the design of such kits, an initial vocabulary to talk about them, and design implications intended to inspire HCI researchers to engage in designing for infrastructures.",

The hypothesis is that art can mediate between computer code and human comprehension to overcome the limitations of explanations in and for AI systems. Artists can make the boundaries of systems visible and offer novel ways to make the reasoning of AI transparent and decipherable. Beyond this, artistic practice can explore new configurations of humans and algorithms, mapping the terrain of inter-agencies between people and machines. This helps to viscerally understand the complex causal chains in environments with AI components, including questions about what data to collect or who to collect it about, how the algorithms are chosen, commissioned and configured or how humans are conditioned by their participation in algorithmic processes.",

Community engagement is a prerequisite for obtaining support on social media. In this study, we investigate community engagement for social media about a specific stressful life event, the experience of infidelity. What constitutes infidelity varies from person to person. Here, we focus on people reporting that a romantic partner has done something which the person perceives as an act of infidelity. We chose Reddit, as this platform encourages pseudony-mous discussion. Using unsupervised clustering, we create a typology of posts and commentsthat elicit different levels of community engagement and discuss implications for the management of online communities.",

In this special issue, we seek to explore how value of, and in, participatory and co-design practices could be understood and captured not only to serve the needs of research assessment where the mechanisms and regimes of research impact and value tend towards highly defined, contained conceptions of value but also to enhance the scale, scope, and resourcing of collaborative design. To this end, the authors collected here offer perspectives on emerging ethical and political engagements with ‘value’ as a contested terrain.

The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is a well validated tool for collecting symptom self-reports that covers nine dimensions: depression, anxiety, phobia, paranoia, psychosis, OCD, hostility, somatisation, and interpersonal. In this paper, we investigate to what extent these dimensions are reflected in prosody. Prosody was characterised using five core principal components (PC) derived from GeMAPS analysis of a data set from 8 studies (14907 sound files, 990 participants). We used the data from a subset of 317 participants (5967 sound files, 4 studies) who had completed the BSI. Each BSI dimension shows a distinct pattern of correlations between the number of symptoms reported and our five PCs, but these patterns differwhen comparing undergraduates (more Caucasians, more females) and a patient sample (more African-Americans, more males). We conclude that speech corpora for mental health studies need better demographic balance.",

Results show the creative potential of collaborating with illustrators on data comics and how their approach to the format can inform workshops for all. Challenges to learn from the workshop include the stages to introduce data visualizations and journalistic narratives, the structuring stories and the method of iterations of comic drafts.

We are increasingly data subjects within a complex network of lifestyle devices that sense, monitor and interpret our daily endeavours. When the form that these devices take belies their true nature, a series of social challenges emerge. With the drive to new markets, based solely upon constructing value from human data, we find ourselves in something of a design di-lemma. How can we design socially sensitive ‘things’, and what are the implications arising from networking our private spaces? This paper presents an autoethnograph-ic case study, of a smart toilet roll holder, intended to surface some of these issues. Such prototype technologies demonstrate that, without proper consideration, the level of resulting social disruption may stilt progress and stymie the development of emerging data markets.",

  abstract  = "Technologies such as blockchains, smart contracts and programmable batteries facilitate emerging models of energy distribution, trade and consumption, and generate a considerable number of opportunities for energy markets. However, these developments complicate relationships between stakeholders, disrupting traditional notions of value, control and ownership. Discussing these issues with the public is particularly challenging as energy consumption habits often obscure the competing values and interests that shape stakeholders' relationships. To make such difficult discussions more approachable and examine the missing relational aspect of autonomous energy systems, we combined the design of speculative hairdryers with performance and deliberation. This integrated method of inquiry makes visible the competing values and interests, eliciting people's wishes to negotiate these terms. We argue that the complexity of mediated energy distribution and its convoluted stakeholder relationships requires more sophisticated methods of inquiry to engage people in debates concerning distributed energy systems.",

While these accounts were primarily designed to resemble American citizens, accounts created in 2016 contained German and Italian locations and terms in user profiles, suggesting targeting of wider international electoral processes. Brexit was one of many targets, likely indicating coordinated repurposing of ‘troll’ activity over time. We analyse behavioural shifts in account behaviour in relation to external events, introducing a temporal dimension not typical of political Twitter studies. The ‘troll’ account behaviour altered radically on UK-EU referendum day, shifting from generalised disruptive tweeting to retweeting other troll accounts to amplify their effect.",

  title    = "Tangible Tools for Understanding Distributed Systems",
  abstract = "Data specialists are at the forefront of exploring new ways of exchanging value using blockchain, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts as direct exchanges between things, systems and people. These novel technologies are challenging concepts of value and value exchange in a variety of ways. Far from being neutral, they are entangled with political, economic, social and material arrangements, co-producing new relationships of power and distributed authority, which raises questions of ethics, privacy and trust. This is exemplified by a variety of fast-moving commercial services and new research agendas that explore such technologies in areas as varied as supply chain provenance, healthcare records, aid distribution, forms of digital identity, licensing and copyright agreements. We consider that designers have a unique opportunity to question these novel assemblages which may have a profound impact on our future lives. The emerging nature and increasing use of this underlying technological infrastructure encourages us to rethink current practices of ownership, trust and ethical relationships and to reconsider “value constellations” not as independent entities but entangled networks of people, services and things. This workshop builds on our established research exploring material and experiential tools to explore the role of distributed technology and its socio-material implications, as well as our previous experience working with designers on Blockchain projects across the EU. We will explore the implications of the vastly evolving distributed ledgers and autonomous systems which introduce the principle that products and services may soon be owned and managed collectively and not governed by one person or authority, thus allowing us to rethink traditional concepts of trust, ownership and power. Following on from a previous workshop, this particular half-day design workshop will support participants’ critical understanding of these new forms of distributed power and trust while exploring what tangible tools may offer design researchers in understanding complex technological systems.",

  abstract  = "Background: Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) tests are routinely used in screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this task, participants name as many items as possible of a semantic category under a time constraint. Clinicians measure task performance manually by summing the number of correct words and errors. More fine-grained variables add valuable information to clinical assessment, but are time-consuming. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether automatic analysis of the SVF could provide these as accurate as manual and thus, support qualitative screening of neurocognitive impairment. Methods: SVF data were collected from 95 older people with MCI (n = 47), Alzheimer’s or related dementias (ADRD; n = 24), and healthy controls (HC; n = 24). All data were annotated manually and automatically with clusters and switches. The obtained metrics were validated using a classifier to distinguish HC, MCI, and ADRD. Results: Automatically extracted clusters and switches were highly correlated (r = 0.9) with manually established values, and performed as well on the classification task separating HC from persons with ADRD (area under curve [AUC] = 0.939) and MCI (AUC = 0.758). Conclusion: The results show that it is possible to automate fine-grained analyses of SVF data for the assessment of cognitive decline.",

We gathered the data using the Twitter API and a selection of hashtags chosen by a panel of academic experts. Currently we have in excess of fifty different hashtags and we add to the set periodically to accurately represent the evolving conversation. Twitter has closed the accounts that were documented in the Senate list meaning that these tweets are no longer available through the webpage or API.

We propose Temporal Design as a shift from pace, direction, and subjective experience towards looking at time as emerging out of relations between cultural, social, economic and political forces. We argue that this pluralist perspective helps to demystify problematic experiences, potentially enabling more inclusive ways of understanding time.",

In collaborative workshops with GeoCoin, participants engaged with location-based smart contracts, using the platform to explore digital `debit' and `credit' zones in the city. These exercises led to the design of diverse distributed-ledger applications, for time-limited financial unions, participatory budgeting, and humanitarian aid.

  title     = "Preserving and forgetting in the human brain",
  abstract  = "Humans have evolved to be very efficient at managed preservation of what is necessary to preserve. Humans are also extremely efficient at forgetting trivial or irrelevant details when they are no longer needed. Indeed, managed preservation and forgetting could be viewed as a set of human ‘superpowers’ achieved through use of a lifetime of accumulated knowledge, highly effective contextualisation, aggregation, organisation, summarisation and reconstruction of key features of experiences. But humans are poor at preservation of large amounts of detail. Typically, memories are partially reconstructed during the retrieval process, and this reconstruction process can sometimes lead to false memories. Many of these strengths and limitations of human memory are well understood by human memory researchers, although important questions and uncertainties remain. In complete contrast, digital systems excel in preserving large amounts of detail, and are getting better at contextualisation. But they remain rather poor at systematic forgetting of irrelevant detail. Often, digital forgetting occurs by accident through disk crashes, incompatible upgrades of software and hardware, lost or stolen storage devices. Even if the data are still present and safely stored, insufficient indexing and poor information retrieval may result in those data effectively being forgotten. This chapter will provide a detailed overview of the state of the science of human memory, based on empirical studies and conceptual modelling. It will discuss how the human superpowers of managed preservation and forgetting are achieved, and show how a conceptual understanding of human memory function could be used to inspire the design of digital managed preservation and forgetting. It will argue that human-inspired digital forgetting is key for achieving a truly synergetic relationship between human and digital memory, and explore how such a synergetic relationship can address aspects of the paradox that massive investment in technology has not necessarily led to the expected increase in productivity (IT/productivity paradox). Next, we will describe an in-depth study of personal, digital photograph collections that were contributed by volunteer research participants. This study explored human management of photographic collections and contrasted it with managed preservation and forgetting of the same photo collection by an example digital system that incorporates automated conceptualisation and forgetting. The chapter will conclude with a summary of how understanding human cognitive function can help to inspire more useful digital storage systems that offer reliable and usable tools to complement and support human memory rather than attempt to replace it.",

However making frequent visual reference to mobile devices can be distracting, the user having to interact via a small screen thus disrupting the explorative experience. This research reports on an EU funded project, SpaceBook, that explored the utility of a hands-free, eyes-free virtual tour guide, that could answer questions through a spoken dialogue user interface and notify the user of interesting features in view while guiding the tourist to various destinations. Visibility modelling was carried out in real-time based on a LiDAR sourced digital surface model, fused with a variety of map and crowd sourced datasets (e.g. Ordnance Survey, OpenStreetMap, Flickr, Foursquare) to establish the most interesting landmarks visible from the user's location at any given moment. A number of variations of the SpaceBook system were trialled in Edinburgh (Scotland). The research highlighted the pleasure derived from this novel form of interaction and revealed the complexity of prioritising route guidance instruction alongside identification, description and embellishment of landmark information – there being a delicate balance between the level of information ‘pushed’ to the user, and the user's requests for further information. Among a number of challenges, were issues regarding the fidelity of spatial data and positioning information required for pedestrian based systems – the pedestrian having much greater freedom of movement than vehicles.",

  abstract  = "We report on a controlled user study comparing three visualization environments for common 3D exploration. Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user’s real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.",

We attempt to investigate the design of machines with autonomy, beyond human-centred and anthropocentric views, and present an alternative approach, where machines would not serve or command humans, but exist and evolve in parallel to them. We present this exploration through three design concepts, Gatekeeper on the Mission, Perception Companion, and Poet on the Shore that seek to explore notions of independence, co- dependence and identification between humans and machines.

Ubiquitous and pervasive computing first identified the emerging challenges of studying technology used on-the-move and in widely varied contexts. With IoT, previously sporadic experiences are interconnected across time and space in numerous and complex ways. This increasing complexity has multiplied the challenges facing those who study human experience to inform design. This paper describes the results of a study that used a chatbot or ‘Ethnobot’ to gather ethnographic data, and considers the opportunities and challenges in collecting this data in the absence of a human ethnographer. This study involved 13 participants gathering information about their experiences at the Royal Highland Show. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ethnobot in this setting, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of chatbots as a tool for ethnographic data collection, and conclude with recommendations for the design of chatbots for this purpose.",

  abstract  = "The standard dementia screening tool Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the standard dementia staging tool Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) are prominent methods for answering questions whether a person might have dementia and about the dementia severity respectively. These methods are time consuming and require well-educated personnel to administer. Conversely, cognitive tests, such as the Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF), demand little time. With this as a starting point, we investigate the relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores. We use regression models to predict scores based on persons’ SVF performance. Over a set of 179 patients with different degree of dementia, we achieve a mean absolute error of of 2.2 for MMSE (range 0–30) and 1.7 for CDR-SOB (range 0–18). True and predicted scores agree with a Cohen’s of 0.76 for MMSE and 0.52 for CDR-SOB. We conclude that our approach has potential to serve as a cheap dementia screening, possibly even in non-clinical settings.",

  abstract = "A person’s mental health can be reflected in their speech. Recent studies have used machine learning to detect signs of mental illness from hundreds of acoustic features. However, the resulting algorithms can be hard to interpret clinically. The Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set for voice researchand affective computing (GeMAPS) partly addresses this issue by providing a standard, restricted set of 88 acoustic variables.In practice, though, many of these variables covary, and can thus be summarised into more easily interpretable metavariables.Using principal component analysis, we derive a set of eight such meta-variables for a data set of 17949 samples from nonpsychiatric adults and adults with a diagnosis of mania, depression, psychosis, or schizophrenia. We show that (a) there are significant differences between healthy controls and people with a mental illness on these variables; and (b) the patterns ofthese differences (size and significance) vary depending on the condition.",

  title     = "Blockchain City: Spatial, social and cognitive ledgers",
  abstract  = "City dashboards are typically representations of a city’s accounts, manifest according to values set by the stakeholders. The currency of the data within a dashboard is typically reduced to an assessment of the performance of services largely derived from quantitative sources. Whilst such databases may be useful for mayors to report on the performance of a local government, or use it to set targets that lead to penalties or bonuses, the city workers and inhabitants that are complicit in the production of data are rarely aware of the nature of the ‘ledger’ that they are contributing to. As a consequence, dashboards cannot describe many of the transactions that take place between people, nor can they make explicit the values that are brokered between the myriad of city occupants.This paper explores different perspectives upon economic and socio/geographical ledgers and the complexity that they involve as they inevitably collide with concepts of chronological time, representation and actions. The paper introduces three means of approaching the concept and practice of the ledger: i. Money, Time and the Blockchain: an exploration of how the representation of money shifts from its material representation within fiat currencies to the Blockchain, the sealed distributed ledger that supports the Bitcoin cryptocurrency; ii. City as Ledger: a recovery of the role of time in the production of economic geographies with a focus upon Hagerstrand’s approach to time-geography that accounted for personal and group actions within temporal and spatial frames, and inevitably a recovery of Marx and the obfuscation of histories and geographies; and iii. Cognitive and practice based ledgers: introduces the telling of stories through film as a form of cognitive ledger and uses the Dardennes film ‘Two Days and One Night’ as an preface to the framing of the automobile production line as a form of material ledger, which for those who work upon them has changed dramatically from traditional Fordist models to the more contemporary Toyota Production System.These three theoretical perspectives on ledgers set the scene for the introduction of two design pieces produced from the Design Informatics studio at the University of Edinburgh and make explicit some of the temporal and social potentials for using ledgers within design experiences.By reflecting on the role of ledgers in their many different forms, this formative paper establishes the complexity of both capturing and producing data across a myriad of social practices using linear systems.",

  title    = "Give me your data, and I will diagnose you",
  abstract = "The literature on medical and health informatics is full of studies that attempt to contribute to, suggest, or even make a medical diagnosis based on continuous data streams that individuals generate through their interaction with technology, such as smartphones, wearable devices, or social media. The conditions that are being diagnosed are often highly stigmatised (e.g., depression) or incurable (e.g., dementia). The discourse that justifies these studies posits early diagnosis as desirable, since early intervention is thought to reduce health care costs and increase the chances of a cure (for curable conditions). It is also often assumed that rational people will submit to ongoing monitoring merely because they are at risk of developing a condition. I will critically interrogate this discourse through the lens of three concepts: biographical illness work; evidence-based medicine; and neurodiversity. Evidence-based medicine emphasises the uncertain nature of much diagnostic work, and critically questions the basis on which diagnoses are made. Biographical illness work covers how people interpret the diagnoses they receive, how diagnosis affects their identity, and how they cope with preconceptions and stigma associated with a diagnosis. Finally, neurodiversity questions what should be regarded as normal, instead focusing on the experience of people who live with a particular condition. I will conclude by showing how this critical interrogation can stimulate the design of new processes, contexts, and technologies that give people greater control over who infers what about their health from their data.",

From a critique of acceleration to an urge to frame present actions within more extended futures, designers have been analysing how different temporal perceptions may influence practices and how they can be influenced by design. In this paper, we argue that in order to challenge problematic relationships to time, designers should consider time in radically different terms. Instead of regarding time largely in terms of pace and direction, they should start considering the complexity of aspects that sustain the coordination of particular groups. We present this approach through the concept of Temporal Design, which endeavours to reveal actors, practices and forces that determine social coordination within specific contexts. By surfacing this complexity, temporal design would allow it to be discussed, possibly demystifying problematic experiences and enabling more inclusive ways of understanding time.",

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.",

In contrast to the conventional PE set-up, where an MT system first produces a static translation hypothesis that is then edited by a professional (hence “post-editing”), ITP constantly updates the translation hypothesis in real time in response to user edits. Our study involved nine professional translators and four reviewers working with the web-based CasMaCat workbench. Various new interactive features aiming to assist the post-editor/translator were also tested in this trial. Our results show that even with little training, ITP can be as productive as conventional PE in terms of the total time required to produce the final translation.

We examined introductory mentions of on-screen shapes within a joint task for effects of access to the addressee's attention, of players' actions and of speakers' roles. Only speakers' actions affected the form of referring expression and only different role dyads made egocentric use of actions hidden from listeners. Analysis of players' gaze around referring expressions confirmed this pattern; only same role dyads coordinated attention as the accessibility theory predicts.

  title    = "Experienced old eyes can look young in HCI research",
  abstract = "Eye-tracking studies have demonstrated that older people tend to exhibit poorer visual engagement with screen-based technologies than young adults; notably slower eye movements and longer fixation durations. The assumption has been that these findings are attributable to physiological and cognitive degradation associated with normal aging [1]. In other words, reduced performance is inevitable and predictable by chronological age. The size of these effects can be task dependent, but evidence across a range of HCI tasks suggests that computer experience can reduce age-related differences in viewing behaviour [2]. Eye-movement patterns and distributions for experienced older adults are remarkably close to those for younger adults carrying out similar tasks. And within a sample of older adults (n=18, age range: 70-93), even a minimal level of computer familiarity is enough to create significantly distinguishable groups. This implies that treating all older adults as a single cohort is a gross oversimplification. Additionally, in many usability studies these visual aspects of interaction are confounded by physical performance difficulties, such as mouse control or typing. Models of visual behaviour and eye movements should therefore consider computer experience as a variable as well as age.",

  title    = "Punctuation has a point, so use it!",
  abstract = "It is all too common for systems processing natural language, whether for input (automatic speech recognition, text queries, dialogue etc.) or output (text-to-speech), to ignore or strip out punctuation. The effect of prosodic factors, such as intonation and pausing, on language processing remains controversial. While there is an obvious relationship between punctuation and prosody it cannot be a simple mapping: grammatical rules prevent the inclusion of punctuation at points where a speaker might pause, and the set of punctuation is not rich enough to transcribe all the spoken features categorised as prosody. It is therefore important for any realistic text-to-speech (or speech-to-text) conversion to consider these important features of language. An experimental investigation showed that commas exert a consistently strong and direct rhetorical influence on sentences being read aloud. They result in the slower delivery of words preceding the comma and an increase in pauses in speech. While the lengthening effect is an uncontroversial feature found at the end of clauses, even in the absence of punctuation, there is evidence to suggest that the comma is particularly useful in acoustically segmenting text by stimulating a gap, or period of silence, between linguistic units. This is particularly salient at points where a break can convey disambiguating information. Somewhat surprisingly, commas do not induce shifts in the fundamental frequency of speech or alter intonational patterns. Any generation of naturalistic synthetic speech should therefore take these factors into consideration.",

  title     = "Clustering of Gaze During Dynamic Scene Viewing is Predicted by Motion",
  abstract  = "Where does one attend when viewing dynamic scenes? Research into the factors influencing gaze location during static scene viewing have reported that low-level visual features contribute very little to gaze location especially when opposed by high-level factors such as viewing task. However, the inclusion of transient features such as motion in dynamic scenes may result in a greater influence of visual features on gaze allocation and coordination of gaze across viewers. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of low- to mid-level visual features to gaze location during free-viewing of a large dataset of videos ranging in content and length. Signal detection analysis on visual features and Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering gaze was used to identify the contribution of visual features to gaze location. The results show that mid-level visual features including corners and orientations can distinguish between actual gaze locations and a randomly sampled baseline. However, temporal features such as flicker, motion, and their respective contrasts were the most predictive of gaze location. Additionally, moments in which all viewers’ gaze tightly clustered in the same location could be predicted by motion. Motion and mid-level visual features may influence gaze allocation in dynamic scenes, but it is currently unclear whether this influence is involuntary or due to correlations with higher order factors such as scene semantics.",

  title     = "Going with the flow? The endogenous/exogenous influences on gaze control in dynamic scenes",
  abstract  = "Where does one attend when viewing dynamic scenes? Unlike static scenes, the inclusion of transients such as motion and the flow of information in a dynamic scene may result in a greater exogenous control of attention but also necessitate moment-by-moment endogenous guidance in order to filter out irrelevant visual events. These factors were investigated in a series of studies recording the eye movements of participants whilst they watched a range of composed (e.g. TV and film) and naturalistic dynamic scenes under different viewing tasks. The best low-level predictor of gaze allocation during free-viewing of dynamic scenes is motion and motion contrast predicts the degree of clustering of gaze across multiple viewers. However, this bias towards motion can be overridden by viewing tasks that prioritise static features such as background, e.g. recognise the location. Gaze behaviour whilst free-viewing dynamic scenes depicting people engaged in recognisable events (e.g. doing the laundry) suggest that attention to motion may not be evidence of exogenous capture but rather a moment-by-moment interaction between motion, the semantic structure of naturalistic events and higher-order factors such as familiarity, memory and expectation.The data presented was gathered during projects funded by the Leverhulme Trust (Ref F/00-158/BZ) and the ESRC (RES-062-23-1092).",

Studies into the effect of age on eye-movement behavior tend to indicate a propensity for slower viewing and longer times spent examining information. This pattern is usually attributed to the general physiological and cognitive slow-down associated with normal aging. In this paper, however, across three different tasks based on computer and internet use (free-viewing, visual search, and browser interaction), we show that among older adults (n=18, age range: 70-93) computer experience appears to be a highly important factor in eye-movement behavior.

In the present article, we describe a system that makes it possible to study visual attention in coordination with other activity during joint action. The software links two eyetracking systems in parallel and provides an on-screen task. By locating eye movements against dynamic screen regions, it permits automatic tracking of moving on-screen objects. Using existing SR technology, the system can also cross-project each participant’s eyetrack and mouse location onto the other’s on-screen work space. Keeping a complete record of eyetrack and on-screen events in the same format as subsequent human coding, the system permits the analysis of multiple modalities. The software offers new approaches to spontaneous multimodal communication: joint action and joint attention. These capacities are demonstrated using an experimental paradigm for cooperative on-screen assembly of a two-dimensional model. The software is available under an open source license.",

  abstract  = "Accessibility theory (Ariel, 1988; Gundel, Hedberg, & Zacharski, 1993) proposes that the grammatical form of referring expression depends on the accessibility of its referent, with greater accessibility permitting more reduced expressions. This paper presents evidence discriminating between Realist and Declarative views of how accessibility will be determined. First, it presents a corpus study of first mentions of on-screen objects produced during a joint construction task. As the Declarative view suggests, elaboration of referring expressions is not controlled only by real local circumstances but instead differs with the assigned ability of interlocutors to declare how the dialogue will proceed. Second, it shows that speakers’ visual attention around such expressions supports the same model. The context of a joint physical task does automatically align players’ attention. Instead, players who declare accessibility inappropriate to their listeners’ perspectives align attention poorly, while those whose expressions show better design, have gaze patterns predictable from accessibility theory.",

  abstract  = "Generating referring expressions is a task that has received a great deal of attention in the natural-language generation community, with an increasing amount of recent effort targeted at the generation of multimodal referring expressions. However, most implemented systems tend to assume very little shared knowledge between the speaker and the hearer, and therefore must generate fully-elaborated linguistic references. Some systems do include a representation of the physical context or the dialogue context; however, other sources of contextual information are not normally used. Also, the generated references normally consist only of language and, possibly, deictic pointing gestures.When referring to objects in the context of a task-based interaction involving jointly manipulating objects, a much richer notion of context is available, which permits a wider range of referring options. In particular, when conversational partners cooperate on a mutual task in a shared environment, objects can be made accessible simply by manipulating them as part of the task. We demonstrate that such expressions are common in a corpus of human-human dialogues based on constructing virtual objects, and then describe how this type of reference can be incorporated into the output of a humanoid robot that engages in similar joint construction dialogues with a human partner.",

  abstract  = "While it has been widely assumed that punctuation may play a critical role in reading, there has been relatively little direct empirical investigation of its effects on the process in general or eye movements in particular. Most research on sentence parsing has either avoided the use of punctuation or simply assumed that it necessarily serves a disambiguating role. There has been little or no consideration of how ‘disambiguation’ might occur or of the precise nature of the effects that punctuation might have on the reading process. Previous work using self-paced reading (Hill and Murray, 1997a, b) has in fact shown that simplistic assumptions related to the disambiguating effect of punctuation cannot be supported. These studies demonstrated that while punctuation plays a potent disambiguating role in some structures, the effect is by no means universal. It remained unclear, however, whether these conclusions could be generalised to a more natural reading situation and whether eye-movement patterns while reading punctuated text provide an insight into the underlying parsing mechanisms. In this chapter we discuss more recent studies which have extended this work by monitoring subjects’ eye movements while reading exemplars of three types of locally ambiguous items with and without inserted punctuation. In order to control for simple oculomotor effects related to the additional spacing associated with punctuation, the studies also included a condition with equivalent spacing but without punctuation. The results show potent effects of punctuation on the first-pass processing of two structures (early-closure and reduced relative-clause constructions), but not in the ‘preferred’ versions of either of these and not in sentences containing prepositional phrase ambiguities. Punctuation also exerted effects on local processing difficulty, suggesting that it cues parsing decisions at particular points in a sentence. Frequently, inserted punctuation increased processing time on sections of a sentence immediately preceding a comma, while facilitating the processing which followed. The focus of this chapter, however, is on the effects of punctuation on eye-movement parameters in punctuated and unpunctuated sentences, the ways in which these differ from unpunctuated sentences with equivalent spacing and the extent to which they reflect the processing consequences of punctuation and spacing. It was found that punctuation and increased spacing between words had similar effects on the pattern of eye movements with increases in saccade extent of more than the added character space, but this similarity was not mirrored in equivalent effects on reading time and disambiguation. Punctuation therefore appears to convey information related to structure that is more potent than the simple ‘chunking’ of text, but this effect is limited to particular structural conditions. The results also suggest a dissociation between some eye-movement parameters and their consequences for underlying sentence processing.",
